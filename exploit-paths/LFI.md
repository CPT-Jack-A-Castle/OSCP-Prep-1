## LFI Local File Inclusion
- An attacker can use Local File Inclusion (LFI) to trick the web application into exposing or running files on the web server.
- LFI occurs when an application uses the path to a file as input. If the application treats this input as trusted, a local file may be used in the include statement.
- Example:
````
/**
* Get the filename from a GET input
* Example - http://example.com/?file=filename.php
*/
$file = $_GET['file'];

/**
* Unsafely include the file
* Example - filename.php
*/
include('directory/' . $file);
````
- In the above example, an attacker could make the following request. It tricks the application into executing a PHP script such as a web shell that the attacker managed to upload to the web server.
````
http://example.com/?file=../../uploads/evil.php
````
- Even without the ability to upload and execute code, a Local File Inclusion vulnerability can be dangerous. 
- An attacker can still perform a Directory Traversal / Path Traversal attack using an LFI vulnerability as follows.
````
http://example.com/?file=../../../../etc/passwd
````
